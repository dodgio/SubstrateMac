SubstrateMac is a port of Substrate Watercolor by J. Tarbell to Mac and iOS.

Some code was adapted from the xscreensaver version -- http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/

In order for the project to build correctly all graphics are in place. Some of these mention Hey Daddio! and are copyright Hey Daddio! I will replace them shortly with generic graphics. Please don't distribute versions of SubstrateMac with the Hey Daddio! graphics. Thanks.

Currently the Mac screensaver version of the code is probably broken. For iOS version 2.0 I added several things that weren't very compatible with the Mac version. I'll get this straightened out soon.
